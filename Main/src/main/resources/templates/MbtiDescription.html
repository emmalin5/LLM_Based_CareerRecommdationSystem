      {
        code: 'ISTJ', role: 'Logistician', traits: 'Responsible, practical, fact-minded',
        overview: 'The ISTJ personality is built on a foundation of structure, facts, and responsibility. These individuals often approach life with a strong preference for routines and traditions, seeking to fulfill their duties with precision and honesty. Their commitment to order and clarity allows them to stay grounded and dependable, making them pillars of reliability in both personal and professional settings.',
        strengths: 'ISTJs value honesty and directness, steering clear of lies or manipulative behavior. Their disciplined nature shines through in their patience and reliability, as they consistently keep their promises. Calm and practical under pressure, ISTJs make clear, logical decisions that others can trust. Their dedication to being straightforward and precise gives them a strong moral compass that guides their every action.',
        growth: 'ISTJs are often "by the book," preferring clear rules and structure, which means they can feel stressed or uneasy when faced with unstructured or highly flexible situations. They have a strong respect for facts and evidence, sometimes leading them to judge or look down on those who ignore reality. Their blunt honesty, while rooted in integrity, can unintentionally hurt more sensitive individuals who might be less direct in their communication.'
      },
      {
        code: 'ISFJ', role: 'Defender', traits: 'Protective, warm, reliable',
        overview: 'The ISFJ personality type quietly dedicates themselves to the well-being of others, often choosing to work behind the scenes where their thoughtful and consistent actions provide care and support. They possess a strong sense of duty and are motivated by a desire to protect and nurture, creating environments where people feel safe and valued. This gentle approach makes them natural caregivers and loyal friends.',
        strengths: 'ISFJs are highly observant, noticing the subtle details about others that help them understand their feelings and experiences. Their reliability is evident in the careful, steady way they work to ensure tasks are done completely and well. When passionate about a cause, ISFJs commit wholeheartedly, putting full effort into making a positive impact. Their enthusiasm, paired with a genuine concern for others, allows them to be a steady presence in any group.',
        growth: 'Despite their many strengths, ISFJs often struggle with sharing their own opinions and taking credit for their contributions, tending to be overly humble. They are sensitive to criticism and may take negative feedback personally, which can hurt them deeply if they feel unappreciated. ISFJs also tend to repress their own feelings to avoid conflict, which can lead to misunderstandings and emotional buildup over time.'
      },
      {
        code: 'INFJ', role: 'Advocate', traits: 'Insightful, creative, idealistic',
        overview: 'INFJs seek deep meaning in both life and relationships, driven by a vision of a better world. They often navigate life quietly yet profoundly, striving to help others grow and flourish in meaningful ways. Their idealism and creativity empower them to see beyond the surface and grasp the true emotions and needs of the people around them. INFJs live with a passionate commitment to their values and the hope of making a positive difference.',
        strengths: 'INFJs possess remarkable insightfulness, allowing them to understand what others truly feel and need beneath superficial appearances. Their passion for their goals is heartfelt, fueling their desire for a life filled with meaning rather than mere routine or comfort. Creative by nature, they enjoy expressing themselves through fresh, original ideas, often bringing unique perspectives to complex situations. Their depth of feeling and thoughtful nature inspires those fortunate enough to know them.',
        growth: 'INFJs can be very sensitive to criticism, especially when it challenges their core beliefs, and may take negative feedback deeply to heart. Though honest, they tend to keep their struggles private, reluctant to open up in order not to burden others with their difficulties. They sometimes avoid the ordinary, everyday tasks necessary to achieve great things, which can create challenges in following through on their visionary ideas.'
      },
      {
        code: 'INTJ', role: 'Architect', traits: 'Strategic, logical, innovative',
        overview: 'INTJs are future-focused strategists who rely on logic and innovation to build detailed plans and systems. They trust their insights and research more than outside opinions, often formulating confident, well-founded views. Their curiosity drives them to explore new and unusual ideas, provided these are backed by evidence. They eagerly revise their thinking when presented with proof, viewing challenges as opportunities for growth.',
        strengths: 'The strengths of INTJs lie in their rationality and informed decision-making. They excel at logical thinking and have a strong commitment to understanding facts deeply. Their curiosity fuels continuous learning, allowing them to refine their perspectives and adapt when necessary. This blend of strategic vision and intellectual rigor empowers them to develop smart, long-term solutions to complex problems.',
        growth: 'Despite their strengths, INTJs can be seen as rigid in their adherence to logic and facts, occasionally overlooking emotional or social nuances. Their reliance on evidence might make them appear dismissive of less tangible ideas or feelings. They may struggle with flexibility when things don’t fit their structured approach, and their intensity can sometimes alienate others who don’t share their focused mindset.'
      },
      {
        code: 'ISTP', role: 'Virtuoso', traits: 'Bold, practical, hands-on',
        overview: 'ISTPs interact with the world through direct, practical experiences, often thriving on fixing, creating, or solving problems as they arise. Their hands-on approach means they prefer to figure things out in real time, embracing spontaneity and flexibility. Independent and resourceful, ISTPs enjoy working alone, where their creativity and problem-solving skills flourish.',
        strengths: 'The hallmark strengths of ISTPs include their practical creativity and resourcefulness. They are handy and capable, using their skills to bring ideas to life effectively. Their spontaneous nature makes them quick thinkers, ready to act decisively in the moment. This combination of independence and hands-on ability allows them to tackle challenges with confidence and skill.',
        growth: 'ISTPs may struggle with emotional sensitivity, often prioritizing logic over feelings, which can make them appear insensitive. Their private, reserved nature means they often keep to themselves and avoid sharing personal thoughts. At times, their independence may border on unapologetic disregard for others’ feelings or preferences, leading to misunderstandings or strained relationships.'
      },
      {
        code: 'ISFP', role: 'Adventurer', traits: 'Gentle, artistic, flexible',
        overview: 'ISFPs experience life deeply through their feelings and senses, often expressing themselves through art, music, or a connection to nature.

Their passion drives them to fully engage in what excites them, though they often do so quietly.',

Their passion fuels their focused dedication to what inspires them, enabling them to immerse themselves fully in their creative pursuits and personal interests.',
        growth: 'Though loving freedom, ISFPs may struggle with structure and long-term planning, sometimes feeling trapped or overwhelmed by rules and routines. Their unpredictability can cause challenges in relationships and financial stability. Under stress, they may withdraw or lose their usual calm and creativity, which can make difficult situations even harder to manage.'
      },
      {
        code: 'INFP', role: 'Mediator', traits: 'Empathetic, idealistic, imaginative',
        overview: 'INFPs navigate life guided by deep personal values and the search for meaning.

Their idealism drives a strong desire to support others and share good fortune, ensuring that everyone’s voice is heard. This makes them deeply empathetic and generous with their emotions.',
        strengths: 'The generosity of INFPs manifests in their desire to help and uplift others, along with their empathetic understanding of people’s emotions. Their creativity allows them to explore new ideas and unique perspectives, making them imaginative problem-solvers and dreamers. Their ability to connect emotionally with others fosters a supportive and caring environment around them.',
        growth: 'INFPs sometimes have unrealistic expectations fueled by idealistic dreams that reality cannot always meet, which can lead to disappointment. Their imaginative nature may cause them to become unfocused or distracted, making it difficult to complete tasks. Emotionally vulnerable, they can become overwhelmed by feeling others’ emotions deeply if they don’t take care to protect themselves.'
      },
      {
        code: 'INTP', role: 'Logician', traits: 'Analytical, curious, inventive',
        overview: 'INTPs are analytical thinkers who dive deeply into systems, theories, and ideas in search of truth and understanding. They enjoy challenging assumptions and solving abstract problems on their own terms. Curious and open-minded, they are always eager to learn and explore new concepts, even if their interests shift frequently.',
        strengths: 'The strengths of INTPs lie in their analytical minds, capable of noticing patterns and details that others miss. Their open-mindedness makes them willing to revise their views based on new evidence. This intellectual curiosity drives them to continually seek knowledge, pushing boundaries in thought and innovation.',
        growth: 'INTPs may become impatient when others don’t grasp their ideas or seem uninterested, which can hinder communication. Their preference for logic over emotions might make them appear insensitive to social norms or feelings. Often dissatisfied, INTPs feel things could always be better, which may lead to a restless search for new problems rather than finishing existing projects.'

They communicate clearly and directly, ensuring others understand exactly where they stand, which makes them natural leaders in dynamic environments.',
        growth: 'ESTPs can be impulsive, sometimes acting without fully considering long-term consequences, driven by a need to avoid boredom.

Honest and direct communicators, ESFPs make it clear what they think and feel, creating open and genuine interactions.',
        growth: 'ESFPs tend to avoid conflicts, quickly moving past them to seek more enjoyable experiences. Their need for excitement can lead to impulsive decisions and boredom with routine.

Their energetic drive fuels their willingness to work hard and solve difficult problems.',
        growth: 'ENTPs may be intolerant of ideas or people who cannot logically defend their views, sometimes dismissing them quickly.
